### Improvements in Version 2

- Floats and fixed column have been replaced with flexbox. 
- Supporting images no longer required. All visuals are handled through CSS.
- Slickmap is now responsive to all viewport widths and mobile devices.
- New and improved color scheme.
- Updated version with original color scheme is also available on Github. 

### How To Use

1. Create an HTML file with an unordered list of links. Slickmap was
   designed to style actual linked navigation, not simply lists, so make
   sure to include anchor tags. See index.html for the correct formatting.

2. Apply slickmap.css as you would any other stylesheet, using it for both
   "screen" and "print" media as seen here:

   `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen,print" href="slickmap.css" />`

3. Within your HTML file, the link to your home page should be at the top
   of the unordered list and have the id of #home. This is required to pull
   the home page link out above the rest of the site tree.

4. Responsive media queries are provided at the end of slickmap.css to optimize
   the layout for the exact number of columns you require. To do it, remove or
   comment out the queries that go beyond the number of columns you need. For
   example if your sitemap is 4 columns, remove queries for columns 5 and over.
